###Getting started

	git clone https://github.com/lh3/bwa.git
	cd bwa; make
	./bwa index ref.fa
	./bwa mem ref.fa read-se.fq.gz | gzip -3 > aln-se.sam.gz
	./bwa mem ref.fa read1.fq read2.fq | gzip -3 > aln-pe.sam.gz

###Introduction

BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large
reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms:
BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina
sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from
70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as the support of
long reads and chimeric alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is
generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more
accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp
Illumina reads.

For all the algorithms, BWA first needs to construct the FM-index for the
reference genome (the **index** command). Alignment algorithms are invoked with
different sub-commands: **aln/samse/sampe** for BWA-backtrack,
**bwasw** for BWA-SW and **mem** for the BWA-MEM algorithm.

###Availability

BWA is released under [GPLv3][1]. The latest souce code is [freely
available][2] at github. Released packages can [be downloaded][3] at
SourceForge. After you acquire the source code, simply use `make` to compile
and copy the single executable `bwa` to the destination you want. The only
dependency of BWA is [zlib][14].

###Seeking helps

The detailed usage is described in the man page available together with the
source code. You can use `man ./bwa.1` to view the man page in a terminal. The
[HTML version][4] of the man page can be found at the [BWA website][5]. If you
have questions about BWA, you may [sign up the mailing list][6] and then send
the questions to [bio-bwa-help@sourceforge.net][7]. You may also ask questions
in forums such as [BioStar][8] and [SEQanswers][9].

Please note that the last reference is a preprint hosted at [arXiv.org][13]. I
do not have plan to submit it to a peer-reviewed journal in the near future.
