## Introduction

Bwakit is a self-consistent installation-free package of scripts and precompiled
binaries, providing an end-to-end solution to read mapping. In addition to the
basic mapping functionality implemented in bwa, bwakit is able to generate
proper human reference genome and to take advantage of ALT contigs, if present,
to improve read mapping and to perform HLA typing for high-coverage human data.
It can remap name- or coordinate-sorted BAM with read group and barcode
information retained. Bwakit also *optionally* trims adapters (via
[trimadap][ta]), marks duplicates (via [samblaster][sb]) and sorts the final
alignment (via [samtools][smtl]).

Bwakit has two entry scripts: `run-gen-ref` which downloads and generates human
reference genomes, and `run-bwamem` which prints mapping command lines on the
standard output that can be piped to `sh` to execute. The two scripts will call
other programs or use data in `bwa.kit`. The following shows an example about
how to use bwakit:

```sh
# Download the bwa-0.7.11 binary package (download link may change)
wget -O- http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/bwakit/bwakit-0.7.12_x64-linux.tar.bz2/download \
  | gzip -dc | tar xf -
# Generate the GRCh38+ALT+decoy+HLA and create the BWA index
bwa.kit/run-gen-ref hs38DH   # download GRCh38 and write hs38DH.fa
bwa.kit/bwa index hs38DH.fa  # create BWA index
# mapping
bwa.kit/run-bwamem -o out -H hs38DH.fa read1.fq read2.fq | sh
```

The last mapping command line will generate the following files:

* `out.aln.bam`: unsorted alignments with ALT-aware mapping quality. In this
  file, one read may be placed on multiple overlapping ALT contigs at the same
  time even if the read is mapped better to some contigs than others. This makes
  it possible to analyze each contig independent of others.

* `out.hla.top`: best genotypes for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQA1, -DQB1 and -DRB1 genes.

* `out.hla.all`: other possible genotypes on the six HLA genes.

* `out.log.*`: bwa-mem, samblaster and HLA typing log files.

The format of `out.hla.top` and `out.hla.all` output files is TAB delimited with
each GT line consisting of allele1, allele2, #mismatches/gaps on primary exons, #mismatches/gaps
on other exons and #exons used in typing. If unsure, use the first GT line as the final genotype.

Bwakit can be [downloaded here][res]. It is only available to x86_64-linux. The
scripts in the package are available in the [bwa/bwakit][kit] directory.
Packaging is done manually for now.

## Limitations

* HLA typing only works for high-coverage human data. The typing accuracy can
  still be improved. We encourage researchers to develop better HLA typing tools
  based on the intermediate output of bwakit (for each HLA gene included in the
  index, bwakit writes all reads matching it in a separate file).

* Duplicate marking only works when all reads from a single paired-end library
  are provided as the input. This limitation is the necessary tradeoff of fast
  MarkDuplicate provided by samblaster.

* The adapter trimmer is chosen as it is fast, pipe friendly and does not
  discard reads. However, it is conservative and suboptimal. If this is a
  concern, it is recommended to preprocess input reads with a more sophisticated
  adapter trimmer. We also hope existing trimmers can be modified to operate on
  an interleaved FASTQ stream. We will replace trimadap once a better trimmer
  meets our needs.

* Bwakit can be memory demanding depends on the functionality invoked. For 30X
  human data, bwa-mem takes about 11GB RAM with 32 threads, samblaster uses
  close to 10GB and BAM shuffling (if the input is sorted BAM) uses several GB.
  In the current setting, sorting uses about 10GB.
